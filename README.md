# selenium-test
Simple 3rd party library evaluation via a simple maven project. Selenium is generally used as a way to automation web UI tests, I'm currently using it as a method of automating complicated web GUI operation (i.e. Filling out proper quotation / purchase order form in accordance to business logic). It offers way better control and much more flexibility.
